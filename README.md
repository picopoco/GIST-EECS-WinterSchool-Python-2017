#### Instructor: Taekho Nam, NetCS Lab (thnam@smartx.kr, 010-3536-6217)
#### This document is updated by 2017/01/08.

### Course Description
You will build up a Python environment which can be used for your subsequent researches and course works. I'll try to give you experiences on data manipulation and analysis, visualization, numerical analysis, optimization through 30 hours course. These contents will serve as a alternative (hopefully better) tools of Microsoft速 Excel Mathworks速 Matlab, OriginLab速 OriginPro, and some parts of Wolfram Research速 Mathematica. All topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples, available at [my github repository](https://github.com/TaekhoNam/GIST-EECS-WinterSchool-Python-2017)

This course will cover the following Python packages.
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

This course will handle the following utility programs.
* Anaconda
* Jupyter
* Github
